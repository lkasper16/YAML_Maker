comment: "Inclusive jet production in pPb collisions at a nucleon\u2013nucleon (NN)
  center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} \u200B=$ 5.02 TeV is studied with the CMS
  detector at the LHC. A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
  $30.1 nb^{-1}$ is analyzed. The jet transverse momentum spectra are studied in seven
  pseudorapidity intervals covering the range $\u22122.0 < \u03B7_{CM} < 1.5$ in the
  NN center-of-mass frame. The jet production yields at forward and backward pseudorapidity
  are compared and no significant asymmetry about $\u03B7_{CM} =$ 0 is observed in
  the measured kinematic range. The measurements in the pPb system are compared to
  reference jet spectra obtained by extrapolation from previous measurements in pp
  collisions at $\\sqrt{s} \u200B=$ 7 TeV. In all pseudorapidity ranges, nuclear modifications
  in inclusive jet production are found to be small, as predicted by next-to-leading
  order perturbative QCD calculations that incorporate nuclear effects in the parton
  distribution functions."
